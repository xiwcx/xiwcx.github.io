I have rebuilt this personal website a few times over the years:

- **2014**: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), default [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll), didn't have to configure anything!
- **2018**: [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), wanted to work with a javascript based static site generator
- **2019**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) + [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), wanted an excuse to learn Django and Vue better
- **2021**: [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), back to a static site generator, because deploying and maintaining separate backend and frontend applications was a pain

And now, [Astro](https://astro.build/), because it is fantastically flexible and has good typescript support. I've really enjoyed the experience so far, it really feels like I'll be able to go any direction I would like in the future. Amusingly, I started an Astro rewrite a couple years ago and got distracted after writing my own custom schema and validation layer with [Zod](https://zod.dev/). Now, Astro has pretty much that exact functionality baked in to their [content layer](https://astro.build/blog/future-of-astro-content-layer/), so don't let anyone tell you that procrastination never pays off.

Beyond the technical, I've got two major intentions for this revision of my website.

_Firstly_, on every previous version of the website I failed to kill the [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) in my own brain. I put in an enormous amount of work before launching and then don't touch much outside of content until I rewrite it again. This time, I have put the minimum amount of work in up front to be satisfied with re-launching and I am hoping to be steadier about incremental improvements and tinkering.

_Secondly_, I've recently encountered a lot of people blogging in the classic, low-stakes sense and it has been inspiring. In the past I've had a needlessly high bar for writing. I would only write when I hadn't seen anyone else write on a topic or I hadn't been able to find an answer to my question published elsewhere. This time around, I hope to be far less precious about when I publish.

Thanks to the Astro team for making a fine framework, [Scott Kellum](https://scottkellum.com/) for teaching me everything I know about design and typography, [Pawe≈Ç Grzybek](https://pawelgrzybek.com/) for inspiring me with a wonderfully simple layout, and [Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net/) for her inspiring speaking and writing on the version of the [web we all hope for](https://www.citationneeded.news/fighting-for-our-web/).
