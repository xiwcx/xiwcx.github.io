title: Sass Bites Interview
---

[Micah Godbolt](https://twitter.com/micahgodbolt) and [Elyse Holloday](https://twitter.com/elyseholladay) were kind enough to have me as one of their guest on [Sass Bites](https://www.youtube.com/user/sassbites) in a series about [Front End Architecture](https://github.com/micahgodbolt/front-end-architecture).

I had a blast and the resulting conversation can be viewed here:
