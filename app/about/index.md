# About

I have lived in and around DC for most of my life. The fierce [do it yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself#Subculture) spirit of local bands, drove me as a teenager to teach myself how to make not only the flyers for my own bands' shows, but their websites as well. A stint as a systems administrator nurtured my hobby, which eventually grew into a passion. I enjoy the challenge of crafting performant, responsive, and accessible websites; I'm lucky that it provides me with a living, and I'm currently employed as a web developer by the [National Geographic Society](http://nationalgeographic.com).
