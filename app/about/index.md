# About

I have lived in and around Washington, DC for most of my life. As a teenager I was inspired by the fierce do it yourself spirit of local bands, which drove me to teach myself how to make not only the flyers for my bands' shows, but the websites as well. This hobby was nurtured by a stint as a systems administrator and eventually grew in to a passion. I enjoy the challenge of crafting performant, responsive, and accessible websites. I'm very lucky that it provides me with a living and am currently employed as a front end developer by the [National Geographic Society](http://nationalgeographic.com).
