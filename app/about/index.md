# About

I have lived in and around Washington, DC for most of my life. As a teenager I was inspired by the fierce [do it yourself spirit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself#Subculture) of local bands, which drove me to teach myself how to make not only the flyers for my bands' shows, but the websites as well. This hobby was nurtured by a stint as a systems administrator and eventually grew in to a passion. I enjoy the challenge of crafting performant, responsive, and accessible websites. I'm very lucky that it provides me with a living and am currently employed as a front end developer by the [National Geographic Society](http://nationalgeographic.com).

## Colophon

This website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/). It was scaffolded with [Generator Jekyllrb](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb) and is deployed to [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) using [Grunt Build Control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control).

This site also uses a wealth of other [ruby gems](https://github.com/xiwcx/xiwcx.github.io/blob/src/Gemfile), [bower packages](https://github.com/xiwcx/xiwcx.github.io/blob/src/bower.json), and [grunt plugins](https://github.com/xiwcx/xiwcx.github.io/blob/src/package.json).
