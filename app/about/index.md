# About

I have lived in and around DC for most of my life. The fierce [do it yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself#Subculture) spirit of local bands I encountered as a teenager drove me to start my own bands, book shows, and make flyers. I enjoyed that degree of control over my creative process, so I taught myself how to make websites for my and my friends' bands. While I worked a stint as a systems administrator my hobby grew into a passion. I enjoy the challenge of crafting performant, responsive, and accessible websites; I'm lucky that it provides me with a living, and I'm currently employed as a web developer by the [National Geographic Society](http://nationalgeographic.com).
